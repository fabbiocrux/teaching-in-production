## Welcome  

These are the materials for an invited session for Day 3 of the RStudio Instructor Training and Certification Program, by Dr. Alison Presmanes Hill.

\

## Prework

We assume that you have knit an R Markdown document before, but you donâ€™t need to be an advanced R Markdown user to participate! You'll get the most out of this session if you are familiar with: 

+ the basics of R Markdown^[see <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html> for a refresher],

+ the RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE), and

+ GitHub via the RStudio IDE. 

<aside>You won't have to use GitHub for the session, but many of tools we'll use integrate nicely with version control via GitHub. To get started, complete these [installation instructions](https://happygitwithr.com/install-intro.html), then test your connection between GitHub and RStudio following [these steps](https://happygitwithr.com/connect-intro.html).^[We *strongly recommend* that if you are not already a fluent GitHub user you choose [HTTPS over SSH](https://happygitwithr.com/credential-caching.html).]. </aside>
